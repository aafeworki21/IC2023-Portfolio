    <h1>
From a young age, I had an incredible sense of creativity
<br><br>
and an imagination that I manifested into what I built from
<br><br>
LEGOs. I was that one kid in first grade building mechs while
<br><br>
everyone else was building houses. It was through LEGO that 
<br><br>
I was able to explore my innovative skills at a young age and
<br><br>
enhance my problem solving capabilities. I decided after
<br><br>
falling in love with building things I would persue a career
<br><br>
in doing so.
